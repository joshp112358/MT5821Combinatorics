### Challenge Question: There are three strongly regular graphs on 16 points: The line graph of K4,4; the Clebsch graph , and the Shrikhande graph . For each of these graphs, take the adjacency matrix, and replace 0 by âˆ’1; the result is a Hadamard matrix. Are these Hadamard matrices equivalent?

### To do
embedding L(k33) on a torus.
difference sets of a steiner system. In 1847 Kirkman proved that any
tridivisible complete graph has a triangle decomposition; equivalently, there
is a Steiner Triple System on n vertices if n is 1 or 3 mod 6.
